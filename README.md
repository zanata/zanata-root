Zanata
=====

Zanata is a web-based system for translators to translate 
documentation and software online using a web-browser. It is 
written in Java and uses modern web technologies like JBoss, 
Seam, GWT, Hibernate, and a REST API. It currently supports 
translation of DocBook/Publican documentation through PO 
files. Projects can be uploaded to and downloaded from a Zanata 
server using a Maven plugin or a Python client.

For *developers and writers*: By using Zanata for 
your document translations, you can open up your project for 
translations without opening your entire project in version 
control.

For *translators*: No need to deal with PO files, 
gettext or a version control system - just log in to the website, join 
a language team and start translating, with translation memory (history 
of similar translations) and the ability to see updates from other 
translators in seconds.
